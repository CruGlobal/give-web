A modules folder is pretty much every variation of elements and groups of elements that were specified by classes. Think Brad Frost's [Atomic Design.](http://patternlab.io/) This would normally include things like buttons, form inputs, lists, navigation, header styles and little custom widgets. Again, since Boostrap covers a majority of these styles this folder covers only the files that are not included or that which we wished to expand on.
